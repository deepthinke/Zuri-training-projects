The first task was creating and sing [Local] Python Packages.
it  was basically on creating a simple version of THE "ROCK, SCISSORS PAPER" game with Python. In this version, one player is controlled by the computer and the other player controlled by you - the user (i.e CPU vs Player). 
 Rock-Paper-Scissors is a simple two-player game where, at a signal, players make figures with their hands, representing a rock, a piece of paper, or a pair of scissors. The winner is determined according to a set of rules
